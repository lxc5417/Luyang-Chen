# Class Schedule

### ESL 015:
This course is prepared for students who use English as their second language. I'm taking this course and I have learned how to write and cite in a
correct way. For the picture I use the Palmer Museum one because one of the assignment about contract and comparision was told us to compare two buildings on 
campus and I chose Old Main and Palmer museum.
